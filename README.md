### AI-Powered Responses (RAG)

The AI assistant uses PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search.

**Docker:** Already included - uses `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` image.

**Binary/Manual Install:** Install the pgvector extension:
- Ubuntu/Debian: `apt install postgresql-17-pgvector`
- Or compile from [pgvector/pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)

The extension is automatically enabled during database migration.
